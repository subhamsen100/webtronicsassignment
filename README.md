I Tried opening account at https://hunter.io but for some reason it is not getting activated, so I commented the email verification section, with a working emailhunter account this code will work.
The apis can be accesed at "/docs" path.
after creating the user using "/signup" it is needed to authenticacted for using further routes, click on the lock button beside any route and input the username and pasword and then login, doing it once will be enough,and don't have to repeat for all the api-s, and you can change with other users who are signed up already.
